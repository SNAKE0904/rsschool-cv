## Summary

I started learning Frontend development a year ago. I want to get enough practical knowledge to be useful for the employer and not be a burden for my future team.

I received basic knowledge of html and css at the courses of the Vezom Academy: https://wezom.com.ua/kursy_html5_css3_js. In the future, I have continued to expand my knowledge in this environment with the video courses provided by CourseHunter: https://coursehunter.net/. Also, I've watched various YouTube themed videos that can help me clarify some of the topics.

I am a curious and meticulous person who will not rest until I am sure that I have mastered the material.
